* Traditional Web Development
In traditional web applications clients make requests to a server that responds
with an HTML document describing the page. All the application logic resides in
the server.

* AJAX
In 2005 the term AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) was coined to describe a
new approach to web development in which the content of a web page is
asynchronously fetched with JavaScript without the need to rerender the whole
page.

Despite AJAX having XML in its name, JSON ended up being a more popular format
to exchange data between client and server.

* SPA
Single Page Application is a concept that emerged in recent years. It consists
of fetching a single web page from the server that will be dynamically updated
as needed by JavaScript code running in the client side.
